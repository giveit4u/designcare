#### 8. Category Reversion to Cover & Interior Tab Sizing
- **File**: `app/components/home/Category.tsx`
- **Change**: 
    - Reverted `object-fit` to `cover` for all category images as per user request.
    - Updated the "Interior" (인테리어) tab to use the same sizing dimensions as the "Branding" (브랜딩) tab (26rem width, 19.5rem height).
- **Reason**: User feedback indicated a preference for `object-fit: cover` and ensuring the Interior category matches the Branding category's visual weight.

#### 9. Benefits Section Implementation (Layout 10)
- **File**: `app/components/home/Benefits.tsx`
- **Change**: 
    - Converted component to Client Component (`use client`) to support `framer-motion`.
    - Added scroll-triggered entrance animations (fade-in up for text, fade-in for image).
    - Renamed image asset to `benefits_meeting.avif` and updated dimensions to 600x600 to align with CSS `aspect-ratio: 1`.
    - Enforced `object-fit: cover` on the image.
- **Reason**: To match the dynamic feel of the Webflow design and ensure pixel-perfect image rendering.

#### 10. Category Images & Animation Refinement
- **File**: `app/components/home/Category.tsx`
- **Change**: 
    - **Web Design Tab**: Replaced generic placeholders with specific project images (e.g., Fairpass, Electronic Contract).
    - **Web/App Development Tab**: replaced placeholders with app-specific screenshots (e.g., Zikpay, Baro).
    - **Proposal Tab**: Updated image dimensions to `36rem` width and `20rem` height.
    - **Marquee Animation**: Implemented dynamic duration calculation (`images.length * 3.5s`) to ensure consistent scrolling speed across all tabs, matching the "Branding" tab's pace.
    - **Web Design & App Dev Tabs**: Applied `object-position: 50% 0%` (top-center) to prioritize showing the top part of long screenshots (e.g., full-page designs).
    - **Web/App Development Tab**: replaced placeholders with app-specific screenshots (e.g., Zikpay, Baro).
    - **Proposal Tab**: Updated image dimensions to `36rem` width and `20rem` height.
    - **Marquee Animation**: Implemented dynamic duration calculation (`images.length * 3.5s`) to ensure consistent scrolling speed across all tabs, matching the "Branding" tab's pace.
    - **Web Design & App Dev Tabs**: Applied `object-position: 50% 0%` (top-center) to prioritize showing the top part of long screenshots (e.g., full-page designs).
    - **Web Design Images**: Replaced all existing images with 12 new files (`webdesign-001.avif` through `webdesign-012.avif`) provided by the user.
    - **Scrollbar Hiding**: Updated `.layout504_tabs-menu.no-scrollbar` in CSS to hide scrollbars (`display: none` for webkit, `scrollbar-width: none` for FF) while maintaining scroll functionality.
    - **Proposal Tab Updates**: Updated dimensions to **`34rem x 19.7rem`** effectively matching the initially identified ratio from the 58% padding logic (34 * 0.58 = 19.72). This confirms that 19.7rem is the key to balancing the visual weight and border alignment.
- **Comparison Section (Layout 12)**:
    - **Image Update**: Renamed `/images/광고카피-1_1.avif` to `/images/comparison-main.avif` for ASCII safety.
    - **Dimensions**: Updated image dimensions to `600x600` in the `Image` component to match the intended aspect ratio.
    - **Animation**: Implemented scroll-triggered animations using `framer-motion` (text fades up, image fades in from right), consistent with the 'Benefits' section.
- **Homepage Structure Update**:
    - **Reordering**: Reorganized `app/page.tsx` to include all 15 requested sections in the strict order provided by the user.
    - **Added Components**: Imported previously unused components: `Features` (Layout240), `CTA` (Layout3), `ServiceGallery` (Gallery6), `ImageGallery` (Gallery22), `Pricing` (Pricing25), `Process` (Layout297), `FAQ` (FAQ3), `Logos` (Logo3).
    - **Removed Component**: Removed `<About />` (section_header49) as per user request to delete it.
    - **Fixed Logos Visibility**: Changed `.section_logo3` in `design-care.webflow.css` from `display: none` to `display: block` to correctly reveal the section as per user instruction. Also updated `<Logos />` component to use visible styles.
    - **Branding Tab Updates**: Replaced all 12 images in the 'Branding' tab (`Category.tsx`, id: 1) with the new `Branding-01_b` through `Branding-12_f` files provided by the user.
    - **Prints & Detail Tab Updates**:
        - Replaced all images in the 'Prints' tab (id: 2) with `Prints-01` to `Prints-12`.
        - Replaced all images in the 'Detail Page' tab (id: 3) with `Detail-01` to `Detail-12`.
    - **SNS Tab Updates**: Replaced images in the 'SNS Advertising' tab (id: 4) with `sns-01` to `sns-12` (mixed formats: webp, jpg).
    - **Package Tab Updates**: Replaced images in the 'Package' tab (id: 5) with `Package-01` to `Package-12` (all jpg).
    - **Proposal Tab Updates**: Replaced images in the 'Proposal' tab (id: 6) with `Proposal-01` to `Proposal-12` (all avif).
    - **Web Design Tab Updates**: Replaced images in the 'Web Design' tab (id: 7) with `webdesign-001.avif` to `webdesign-012.avif`.
    - **Web/App Development Tab Updates**: Replaced images in the 'Web / App Development' tab (id: 8) with `Web_App-01` to `Web_App-12` (mixed formats: webp, avif, png).
    - **Interior Tab Updates**: Replaced images in the 'Interior' tab (id: 9) with `Interior-01` to `Interior-12` (all avif).
    - **Hero Section Updates**: Replaced Left column images with `hero-image-L01` to `hero-image-L06` and Right column images with `hero-image-R01` to `hero-image-R06` (mixed formats: webp, avif).
    - **Hero Animation Adjustment**:
    - **Hero Animation Adjustment**:
        - **Left Column**: Starts at `-27.08%` (Staggered/Cut).
        - **Right Column**: Starts at `0%` (Top Aligned/Full).
        - **Layout Fix**: Changed CSS alignment from `items-center` to `items-start` on the columns container. This solves the reported issue where the Right image appeared "in the middle" despite the Keyframe being 0%, as the CSS centering was overriding the animation's top-anchor intent.
        - **Fix Initial State**: Updated `initial` prop to (`-27.08%` / `0%`) to prevent flicker.
        - **Removed Interaction**: Removed hover scaling effect (`hover:scale-[1.02]`) from hero images as per user request to keep the interface clean/static.
    - **Category Tab Updates**:
        - **Hover Interaction**: Added Zoom-In interaction to Category images (`hover:scale-[1.07]`).
        - **Fixed Frame**: Transferred `border-radius: 9px` and `border` styles from the Image to the Image Wrapper (`overflow: hidden`). This ensures the outline and rounded corners remain fixed and do not expand/distort when the image zooms inside, fulfilling the "Fixed Outline" requirement.
    - **Typography Updates**:
        - **Headings**: Updated font weights as requested:
            - **H1, H2, H3**: Set to `font-weight: 800` (ExtraBold) for stronger emphasis.
            - **H4, H5, H6**: Maintained at `font-weight: 700` (Bold).
    - **Category Tab Interaction**:
        - **Tab Button Hover**: Modified hover effect for inactive tab buttons. Removed the background darkening and replaced it with a **15% darker outline** (`box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px #c6c6c6`) using an inset shadow to prevent layout shifts. This creates a cleaner, more subtle interactive state as requested.
        - **Image Viewer Modal Expansion**: Extended the modal viewer functionality to the **'Web Design' tab (ID: 7)**.
            - **Click Interaction**: Clicking a web design image now opens the modal (similar to the Branding tab).
            - **Detail View Refinement**: 
                - **Scrollable Content**: Main image area now supports vertical scrolling (`overflow-y-auto`), allowing users to see full-length landing pages or long vertical designs in detail.
                - **Sidebar UI**: 
                    - 'Select View' heading font size set to `1rem`.
                    - Sidebar width increased to **`225px`** (+25% from previous) for better thumbnail visibility.
                    - Arranged in a **vertical list** for cleaner navigation.
                - **Layout Consistency (Fixed Frame)**: Reconstructed the modal layout so the **gray margin (24px) is fixed and non-scrolling**. The image now scrolls *inside* this fixed frame, ensuring it never touches the edges of the modal window at any point during scroll.
                - **Interaction Fix**: Successfully implemented **Background Scroll Lock** using `useEffect` on `document.body.style.overflow`. This prevents the main page from scrolling when the modal is active.
            - **Image Protection System (Anti-Copy)**:
                - **Server-Side Watermarking**: Implemented a Next.js API route (`/api/watermark`) using the **Sharp** library.
                - **Dynamic Processing**: All portfolio images are now routed through this API, which automatically embeds a subtle, 30-degree rotated "DESIGNCARE" text watermark into the image pixels.
                - **Screenshot & Save Defense**: Since the watermark is part of the image file itself, it persists even if the user takes a screenshot or manages to save the file.
                - **UI/UX Deterrents**: Added `onContextMenu` prevention (disables right-click) and `draggable={false}` to all protected images to further discourage casual theft.
            - **UI Feedback**: Enabled the `cursor-pointer` for Web Design tab image wrappers.
        - **Image Viewer Modal (v2 Refinement)**:
            - **Tab Sizing Fix**: Corrected the 'Web Design' tab image dimensions from vertical `20rem x 32rem` to horizontal `26rem x 19.5rem` to ensure a consistent marquee flow with other categories.
            - **Stabilized Watermarking**: Refactored the `/api/watermark` route to use the standard `Response` constructor, resolving the "Screen Error" caused by binary data handling in Next.js App Router.
            - **Subtle Protection**: Adjusted watermark opacity to `0.05` for a premium, non-intrusive look that still provides screenshot protection.
o max 50% screen width (`maxWidth: 50vw`) to prevent overwhelming the screen.
                - **Sidebar Selector**: Right side (`w-[320px]`), allowing users to "upload" (select) and switch between multiple detail views of the same project.
            - **Z-Index Fix (Portal)**: Modified implementation to use `React.createPortal` rendering to `document.body`. This definitively resolves stacking context issues, ensuring the Modal appears **above all content**, including the Navigation Bar.
            - **Test Data**: Applied multiple detail images to the first Branding item (`Branding-01`) for demonstration.
    - **Verified Mapping**: Confirmed each component corresponds to the requested CSS class/Webflow section ID.
#### 11. Watermark Logo & Modal Selection Refinement
- **Watermarking System (v3)**:
    - **Logo Integration**: Replaced the plain text "DESIGNCARE" watermark with the official `designcare-logo.svg`. 
    - **Orientation**: Rotated the logo to **-20 degrees** (counter-clockwise) and set opacity to `0.12` for a subtle, professional look.
    - **Cache Management**: Incremented version to `v=5` across all image components to ensure the new logo watermark propagates immediately.
- **Universal Image Viewer Modal**:
    - **Global Access**: Removed the category restriction; the modal now opens for images in **all portfolio tabs**.
    - **"Select View" Sidebar Refinement**:
        - **Fixed Header**: The "Select View" text and close icon are now **fixed at the top** of the sidebar, staying visible while thumbnails scroll underneath.
        - **Thumbnail Limit**: Increased the maximum number of visible thumbnails to **5**.
        - **Clean UI**: Completely hid the scrollbar in the sidebar using a `.no-scrollbar` utility (with `!important` flags) while maintaining scroll functionality.
- **Image Quality & Border Consistency**:
    - **Premium Overlay Borders**: To solve "blurry" or "inconsistent" borders during hover/scale, moved the `1px` border to an **absolute overlay** (`z-10`) on top of the image. This ensures the border remains razor-sharp regardless of the image's internal scaling.
    - **Anti-Aliasing**: Applied `WebkitMaskImage` and `isolation: isolate` to prevent "shimmering" or jagged edges on rounded corners during animations.
    - **Color Standardization**: Consolidated on `#e5e5e5` for non-hover borders and `solid black` (2px) for active states.
- **Reason**: To deliver a truly premium and consistent portfolio browsing experience, ensuring the brand logo is correctly represented and the UI feels stable and high-end.

#### 12. Pricing Section & Navbar Refinements
- **Pricing Section Fixes**:
    - **Badge Clipping Resolution**: Resolved an issue where the "Most Popular" badge was being cut off at the top of the cards. This was fixed by increasing the top padding of the card and ensuring `overflow: visible` is applied to all parent containers (tab pane, flex layout).
    - **Hover State Integrity**: Fixed border clipping during hover animations by relaxing overflow constraints and ensuring sufficient spacing between cards.
- **Navbar Enhancements**:
    - **Active Section Highlighting**: Implemented an intersection observer that dynamically changes the navigation link color to brand green (`#068A32`) when the corresponding section is in view.
    - **UI Cleanup**: Removed the bottom border (`border-b`) from the navbar for a cleaner, more seamless transition into the page content.

#### 13. Portfolio (Category) Interaction & Animation Engine Upgrade
- **Innovation**: Replaced the CSS/Framer-based marquee with a custom **High-Performance RAF (requestAnimationFrame) Engine**.
- **Features**:
    - **Seamless Infinite Loop**: Implemented instant x-coordinate normalization that eliminates the "rewind" or "jump" glitch when reaching the end of the image set.
    - **Drag & Swipe**: Added interactive drag functionality. Users can now click and drag (PC) or swipe (Mobile) to manually explore the portfolio.
    - **Smart Animation Control**:
        - **Pause on Modal**: Animation pauses exactly where it is when an image modal is opened.
        - **Resume on Close**: Smoothly resumes from the same position upon closing.
        - **Hover Pause**: Temporarily halts motion when the mouse hovers over the images to allow closer inspection.
    - **Speed Optimization**: Increased the flow speed by **30%** (1.56px/frame) as per user request to create a more dynamic and energetic visual experience.
- **Reason**: To provide a top-tier, app-like interactive experience that feels fluid, responsive, and robust under all user interactions.
